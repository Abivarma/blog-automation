      "source": "arxiv",
      "summary": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis",

      "source": "arxiv",
      "summary": "The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., \"at the game today!\" is a more likely caption than \"a photo of 37 people standing behind a field\". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP,",

      "source": "arxiv",
      "summary": "A growing number of publications address the best practices to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering in recent years. However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages like Python due to their widespread usage training data. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, remains underexplored. This research aims to ut",

      "source": "arxiv",
      "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on comp",
